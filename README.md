# wrapper_scripts
This repository houses wrapper scripts for various Bioinformatics workflows.

## Viralrecon wrapper

The viralrecon wrapper produces a summary output file containing other informative output metrics in addition to the output metrics generated by [nf-core viralrecon](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon). The viralrecon wrapper script is run as a Nextflow Tower post-run script that automatically runs after the completion of Viralrecon run over Nextflow Tower. The script was tested using Viralrecon version 2.4.1.

### Requirements

The requirements to run the viralrecon wrapper script as a post-run script on Nextflow Tower are as follows:

+ **Monochrome logs** must be toggled to ON in the 'Generic options' table when entering launch settings and parameters. Stripping text of the ANSI color codes has not yet been implemented.

+ A bash script that runs the wrapper script. This bash script gets copied into the Nextflow Tower 'post-run scripts' field and is mostly because of character limits in said field.
